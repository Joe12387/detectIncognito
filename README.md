Please note that although this script works on almost all modern browsers, detecting private modes in browsers is very much an arms race. As such, I cannot guarantee that this script will continue to work into the future. However, I will continue to actively maintain this script to support as many browsers as is possible.

If you are aware of any modern browsers this script does not work with, please let me know by creating an issue.

## Notes

- There will be a false positive in certain browser configurations, as well as in Chrome's Guest mode. ([Issue #21](https://github.com/Joe12387/detectIncognito/issues/21)).
- This script does not detect Container Tabs on Firefox as they work differently compared to private mode.
- An error will be thrown if the browser cannot be identified.
- The script only works remotely on a web server using HTTPS. Running the script locally or with HTTP may produce a false result, or it may not run at all.
